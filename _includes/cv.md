 I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <b>Haptik</b> working on fundamental Conversational-AI problems using <b>Deep Learning</b>. I have built the Intent Detection System for Haptik's NLU Engine, which is <b>25% more accurate</b> than their previous system, owning it from Research to Production.
  
 I am also the creator of open source [iNLTK library](https://github.com/goru001/inltk) which provides out of the box support for various NLP tasks, for low resource 12 Indic Languages. The library has <b>20,000+ downloads and 400+ stars</b> on GitHub.
 
 Previously, I have worked at <b>Goldman Sachs</b> with the User Experience and Productivity team on Analytics for Desktop Assistant, which is firm-wide used productivity tool.
 
 I have Advanced Certification in AI and ML from <b>International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-Hyderabad)</b> and Bachelor's in Computer Science from <b>PEC University of Technology.</b>
  
 I am interested in the applications of Machine Learning to solve problems which will impact millions and keep making my little [open source contributions](https://github.com/goru001) towards it. <br><br>
